This project's main goal is to determine how movie data may be examined to provide the most recent analysis and trends. We will discover how the user base is growing and how their interests are changing with  most viewed genres based on the movie data as well as the ratings data obtained 


We will be executing our projects in Apache Spark which as many advantages over the normal processing schemes which mainly includes : 

The speed of the Spark application is significantly faster than that of other big data technologies or apps because to its ability to process and store data in memory. 

Spark's support for lazy assessment aids in the optimization of the stages involved in data processing and management. It offers a higher-level API to boost output and reliability. 

Spark is intended to be a quick, real-time execution engine that can operate on disc and in memory.
